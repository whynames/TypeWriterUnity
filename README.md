# TypeWriterUnity
TypeWriting Effect for Unity

# Has UniTask and Dotween as dependency

You can call PlayAsync function if you need to await. For fire and forget just call Play. Also you can run a function on every new letter, on every letter you can play a typing sound this way. Also there is a callback for oncompleted. It doesn't work good with small font sizes
